# Plot of corona virus development

## Absolute numbers
![](infected-exp.png) 

Development of confirmed  adjusted cases since Jan  22, 2020.  Plotted
with time shifts in order to compare initial exponential phases
after an idea of [Mark Handley](https://twitter.com/MarkJHandley/status/1237119688578138112?s=20) .

The data for Italy are plotted without time shift. E.g. the data for Germany are shifted 9 days
backward in time. They show that as of March 12, Germany is very much on the same track as Italy,
just nine days behind. 



## Logarithmic scale

This is the same plot, just with an logarithmic scale of the y-axis.
